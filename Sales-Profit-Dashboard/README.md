# Sales & Profit Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
---

## Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard analyzes **sales growth, profitability performance, and pricing impact** across regions, product categories, and customer segments.

The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether strong revenue growth is translating into sustainable profitability and to identify key drivers behind margin performance.

---

## Business Objective

Despite strong sales growth, management wanted to evaluate:

- Whether the company is meeting its **15% profit margin target**
- The impact of discounting strategies on profitability
- Regional and category-level margin performance
- Product-level contribution to overall profit and loss

---

## Key Metrics

- **YoY Sales Growth:** 47% ▲  
- **Total Sales:** $2.30M  
- **Total Profit:** $286.40K  
- **Profit Margin:** 12% 🔻 (**3% below 15% target**)  
- **Average Discount:** 16%

---

## Key Insights

- Sales increased significantly (**+47% YoY**), demonstrating strong revenue expansion.
- Profit margin remains below the **15% target** at **12%**, indicating a **3% performance gap**.
- Higher average discounting (**16%**) is contributing to margin compression.
- The **Furniture category** has the highest discount (~17%) and lowest margin (~2%).
- Profitability is concentrated in top-performing products and the **West region**.
- Margin peaked in **2016** before slightly declining in **2017**.

## Analysis Highlights

### Discount vs Margin Impact

Aggressive discounting (**17%**) correlates with margin erosion (~2%), suggesting pricing inefficiencies.

### Regional Profitability

The **West region** consistently delivers stronger profit margins compared to the Central region.

### Category Performance

**Technology** leads in profitability, while **Furniture** presents margin improvement opportunities.

### Product Contribution

Top 10 products drive the majority of profit, while bottom 10 products contribute to margin leakage.

---

## Recommendations

- Optimize discount strategies to reduce margin erosion.
- Reassess pricing in low-margin categories.
- Focus growth efforts on high-margin products and regions.
- Continuously monitor performance against the **15% margin target**.
